            <h5>Beyond Wonderland</h5>
            <p>It's been years since Nocturnal Wonderland morphed naturally into Nocturnal Festival and as the Nocturnal experience has traveled deeper into the night and explored the depths of it’s forested terrain, we feel it’s time to rediscover some of the color and warmth of the original Wonderland event and reshape it into a fresh and novel form, building on and moving further than both of its predecessors and evolving the concept in rich new directions. Insomniac had been producing Nocturnal since 1993.  We’ve thrown Nocturnal Festival for years, and prior to that Insomniac invested close to a decade of love into Nocturnal Wonderland.  We now feel that it’s time to push forward, journeying past the boundaries, and see what lies on the other side of Nocturnal Festival’s darkness.  We will embark on an adventure to the far side of the forest, exploring what exists beyond.</p>

            <h5>Ultra Music Festival</h5>
            <p>The Ultra Music Festival in Miami started as a humble labor of love by two local music fans. These days, it’s the largest electronic music festival in the United States, now spanning some three days, and, during its 2011 edition, selling out all of its tickets and attracting a reported 100,000 attendees. In its first two years, 1999 and 2000, Ultra was basically a polished, daytime beach rave, set on the actual sand of South Beach. Creators Russell Faibisch and Alex Omes were locals who decided to throw their own one-day event coinciding then with the annual Winter Music Conference.</p>

            <h5>Coachella Festival</h5>
            <p>The event that indicated Indio, California would be a quality concert location was a 1993 Pearl Jam concert for 25,000 fans that was part of a regional boycott of Ticketmaster. In October of 1999 the first Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was held. The next year no festival took place, but, in 2001, Coachella was held in April to avoid problems with summer heat. The event has taken place each year since and is one of the largest music festivals in North America. Look for top alternative artists, mega headliners, and reunions of classic bands from the past. A selection of 10 artists from each year is listed.</p>
