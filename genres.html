              <h3>Trance</h3>
              <p>Trance is the most emotional genre. It can make you cry, make you shout, make you cheer, and make you celebrate absolutely nothing of substance except pure, ecstatic bliss. This is interesting, when at one time it was very repetitive and hypnotic (hence its label 'trance') and was very easy to get lost in whilst divulging in aforementioned emotions. But now it's quite difficult to get entranced due mostly to the fact that the genre has devolved into such trite, derivative junk that even the biggest culprits of it are having trouble lying about how interesting it is. If you ignore the cliched, breakdown-build-anthem template side of the genre that is so canned and predictable you can set your watch to it, trance is still pretty fun. Unless you're trying to be a Sasha worshipping pretentious snob not partaking in that, in which case you don't even want to admit you're listening to trance anymore.</p>

              <h3>House</h3>
              <p>House is the most soulful genre. It's also the simplest, the oldest, the warmest, and where electronic music is concerned, easily the most human-sounding, making it the most popular, commanding the most producers, artists, labels, DJs, fans, and subgenres. The whole of top40 pop music gets its hooks, gimmicks, lines and melodies from house music (and vice versa). That is why it stands as the world's perennial party music, and it will probably stay that way until the end of time. Or until someone finds a more catchy beat than the 4/4 bassdrum.</p>

              <h3>Dubstep</h3>
              <p>A London-centric offshoot of U.K. garage that absorbed and transfigured elements of drum'n'bass, techno, and dub, dubstep germinated in the Forward>> club night. Initially held in a Soho venue, Forward>> later extended its reach through a show hosted by Kode9 on the pirate radio station Rinse FM. Like all forms of underground dance music, dubstep was a single-oriented form -- dispersed on labels like Tempa, Tectonic, Hessle Audio, Immerse, and Kode9's Hyperdub -- and its tense, almost oppressively dark sound was built on tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals (which ranged from toasting, to MC'ing, to "proper" R&amp;B-oriented singing). Artists like Burial, Pinch, Benga, and Martyn (a Dutch producer who transitioned from drum'n'bass) thrived with the full-length format, often by emphasizing the haunting ambience that was almost always present within dubstep's harder hitting tracks, in turn making albums geared toward late night home listening. Releases like Burial's Untrue (2007) and the mix albums series Dubstep All-Stars did not quite bring dubstep to the mainstream, but they gained significant critical notoriety and made the style far more accessible to those not located in and around its epicenter.</p>

              <a name="progressive"></a>
              <h3>Progressive</h3>
              <p>Progressive is a pretty pretentious word to begin with, so if you're bold enough to actually call your genre anything like that you better have something pretty fucking impressive, groundbreaking and forward-thinking to call it that. Like, music that will make you fly or breathe underwater or something. Since that's the case, Progressive Trance is easily the most misnamed genre in the history of music. In the annals of trance, it made huge leaps backwards. Most oldskool trance enthusiasts admit that they stopped listening to trance right after Progressive Trance came around (legend states around 96 or so). The genre doesn't actually do anything new or inventive. But what it DID do was codify--that is, write in literal stone--the trance template of breakdown-build-anthem, an infused pop gimmick that all of a sudden made this strange, space-age music suddenly acceptable to the sonically docile masses. No longer long, unwieldy, repetitive and unresponsive, trance became a familiarity, an image, associating itself (and its artists) with all the trappings that keep the pop music world intact. It all went downhill from here.</p>

              <h3>Electro</h3>
              <p>As has often been said, Electro is the missing link of Dance music. All roads lead back to New York where the level of musical innovation and experimentation throughout the early 80s period was quite staggering. It wasnâ€™t one narrow style that never strayed from within the confides of an even narrower BPM range, Electro-Funk was anything goes! The diversity of records released during this period was what made it so magical, you never knew what was coming next. The tempo of these tracks ranged from under 100bpm to over 130, covering an entire rhythmic spectrum along the way. There was no set template for this new Dance direction, it just went wherever it went and took you grooving along with it. It was all about stretching the boundaries that had begun to stifle black music, and its influences lay not only with German Technopop wizards Kraftwerk, the acknowledged forefathers of pure Electro, plus British Futurist acts like the Human League and Gary Numan, but also with a number of pioneering black musicians. Major artists like Miles Davis, Sly Stone, Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder, legendary producer Norman Whitfield and, of course, George Clinton and his P Funk brigade, would all play their part in shaping this new sound via their innovative use of electronic instruments during the 70s (and as early as the late 60s in Miles Davisâ€™ case). Once the next generation of black musicians finally got their hands on the available technology it was bound to lead to a musical revolution as they ripped up the rule book with their twisted Funk.</p>

              <h3>Techno</h3>
              <p>Techno is the depressing, gritty dystopian genre, a musical personification of the industrial, recession-sacked automotive industries of Detroit in the late 80s.The term was lifted from Alvin Toffler's book "The Third Wave", and by 1990 it had become the music press' fancy word for everything electronic. With that said, it makes sense that the best stuff isn't coming from that city anymore, since the word hardly represents the music--even when used in the proper context. But what it lacks in soul it more than makes up in purity of sound and a mythology so romantic that it can't possibly figure out what to do with itself anymore.</p>

              <h3>Drum and Bass</h3>
              <p> Whilst the genre still remains largely underground, this type of electronic dance music has gained wider recognition with use on TV, advertising and infused in the work of more mainstream artists such as Linkin Park, Outcast and even David Bowie (back in the day). Also known as â€˜dnbâ€™ and â€˜drum â€˜nâ€™ bassâ€™ the genre can be defined as a form of electronic music that uses a break beat and whose tempo usually runs between 160-180BPM. Drum and Bass artists are known to produce music which includes samples of other sounds, notably: politic speeches, movies, television programs and other styles of music â€“ giving snippets of other things a completely new perspective within their tracks. The range of sounds that fall under the drum and bass umbrella is vast, with qualities ranging from heavy and pounding to soulful or minimal and atmospheric.</p>

              <h3>Hardcore</h3>
              <p>Hardcore is the musical genre with bi-polar disorder: one half is blistering, sadistic anger, a seething uncontrollable rage that seeks to ruin and wreck everything that exists, including everyone else's fun time. It is hardcore's mission to inundate the world with pointless, seering sonic hell, insisting every chance it gets that it will never be defeated, can not be killed, and refuses to go away no matter how much people want it to. The other half of hardcore is way too silly and stupid to take such anger seriously anymore.</p>
